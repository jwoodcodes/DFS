//// scale and how to build for PCW trade calculator/ calculating my player value score

        ----4 parts to the calculation-----

1) projected production this year (scale from  0-3):
        -all rankings from rotoviz redraft rankings in offseason and 4for4 rest of season in season-
        - below tier 4 gets -1 here
        -tier 4 gets 0 here
        -tier 3 gets 1 point here
        -tier 2 gets 2 points here 
        -tier 1 gets 3 here

 2) market value vs. dynasty value (scale from -3 to 3):
        -worth 1 first or more less in dynasty value vs. market value or 3 tiers lower in dynasty than market gets -4 here
        -worth 2 seconds less in dynasty value vs. market value or 2 tiers less in dynasty than market value gets -2 here
        -within 2 seconds in dynasty value vs. market value and 1 tier less in dynasty than market value gets -1 here
        -same tier in both dynasty and market value and within one second gets 0
        -within 2 seconds in dynasty value vs. market value and 1 tier higher in dynasty than market value gets 1 here
        -worth 2 seconds more in dynasty value vs. market value or 2 tiers higher in dynasty than market value gets 2 here
        -worth 1 first or more more in dynasty value vs. market value or 3 tiers higher in dynasty than market gets 4 here

3) age relative to players positional age apex and combinators with other factors(scale from -8 to 8):

        ps = production score
        mvds= market vs dynasty value score
        combined = ps + mvds

        --age apex by position: QB-28, RB-25, WR-27, TE-28

        combined -5:

          - ps = -1 && mvds = -4:
           -player is at least 2 years below age apex: gets  here
           -player is within 2 years of age apex: gets here
           -player is past age apex: gets -8 here

        //

        combined -4:

         - ps = 0 && mvds = -4:
          -player is at least 2 years below age apex: gets  here
          -player is within 2 years of age apex: gets here
          -player is past age apex: gets -7 hre

4) players magnitude of importance adjustor:


        using my dynasty value tiers
        -if tier 6 move towards zero by 1
        -if tier 7 move towards zero by 2
        -if tier 8 move towards zero by 3
        -if worth less than tier 8 player score should just be zero, they shouldnt be factoring 
         into the evaluation of a trade
