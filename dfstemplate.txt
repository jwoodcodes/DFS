Second highly projected WR bonus,

(This is by just 4for4 projection but can play around with doing it by WR IPS as well)

 Second WR is projected:

                 13 or more gets +20

                 12 or more gets +15

                 11 or more gets +10



efficiency numbers—touchdown rate and yards per attempt—over the last five weeks best predicted how a quarterback would perform in his upcoming contest

Potential for +85 IPS w/o second WR bonus after tgs is calculated and factored in 



Total QB score(player score with all factors that don’t need tgs factored in which include projection, matchup, vtt(Vegas team total), past five game yards per attempt, last five games touchdown rate, and technically second WR bonus although not factored in here as I want it to truly be a bonus as it only applies at all to so few a week) can possible be +65.  This should be multiplied by 1.5 when calculating tgs. Very important to use the unmodified total QB score when calculating QB IPS!!!
