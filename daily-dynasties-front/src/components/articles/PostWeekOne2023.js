          Tua Tagovailoa, Drake London, and the illusion of orthogonality{' '}
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Data points are considered to be orthogonal when they are deemed to be
          statistically independent. Without realizing it, we as fantasy players
          deem data points to be orthogonal and to statistically not effect one
          another when it's not the case. Last season before the frightening
          concussions to tua, with Hill and waddle, in a Mike McDaniel led
          offense, tua was going scorched earth and on his way to being a
          fantasy MVP. This offseason questions about his health and individual
          talent kept his price depressed far below what it should have been. We
          gave far too much credence to Tua the individual and the belief that
          he was the driver of his fantasy success or failure when that was just
          an illusion of those things being orthogonal. The relatively low cost
          for his situation should have trumped any concerns over him the
          individual. There was no reason to believe he couldn't come back from
          the concussions and be the same quarterback he was last year, and
          given his fantasy success last year in the same offense with the same
          playmakers, any questions over his individual talent should have been
          thrown out the window and the situation as a whole weighed to
          determine his value. If that approach was taken his price this
          offseason would have been an instant buy.{' '}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We see a similar situation with Drake London and the Atlanta Falcons.
          In dynasty we very much want to bet on talent. I will never tell
          anyone not to do that. Drake London is a great wide reciever who
          deserves to be bet on long term because I fully believe that someday
          he will be a WR1. Too many wanted to look at his individual efficiency
          metrics and believe that he was so good he was bound to succeed
          though. Arthur Smith showed us what he wanted this offense to be last
          year. Then he spent a top 10 pick on a running back and continued to
          talk about how much work Allgier would get. Flash forward and the most
          likely outcome is already playing out. To make matters worse, the
          Falcons division is terrible and they will almost assuredly win enough
          games for Arthur Smith to be the coach there again next year. There
          were far too many that were willing to believe that drake London and
          his metrics and the team situation were independent variables that
          could be seperated from one another and he could have been sold this
          offseason for a price that quite frankly completely ignored his
          situation.{' '}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {' '}
          <strong>Takeaway: </strong> players team and offensive situation
          should almost never be ignored or dismissed. When we focus too much on
          the Individual player and ignore situation we play situations like Tua
          and London incorrectly. It's easy to take a hurestic like bet on
          talent and apply it too broadly. Applying this to players who already
          have volume and opportunity in bad situations like London is a bet you
          will lose more often than not. Where to apply it properly is on young
          players who have yet to breakout and are not yet seeing the volume,
          But their talent should earn them that volume as the season goes on.

          We in western culture tend to view everything with a lense of duality.
          Good or bad, right or wrong, black or white. In fantasy football we
          are so confident on what is black and what is white and spend our
          energy on arguing over which expensive players are which when the
          largest wins at the lowest cost are in the grey and we hardly talk
          about them at all outside of blurbs to dismiss them as not worth
          talking about.{' '}

        <br />
        <p>
          Every dynasty bench has multiple low value guys on it. In deep bench
          dynasty leagues we will never have rosters full of high value players.
          So who are the low value guys we roster and who should they be? Low
          value players who don't possess a realistic path to greatly out
          preform their cost are roster cloggers and should be replaced by
          players who do.{' '}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          And here's the key.{' '}
          <span className={styles.emphasisSpan}>
            WE DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE THE STORY WILL HAPPEN, IF THERE IS REASON
            TO BELIEVE IT MIGHT, WHEN THE COST IS LOW!{' '}

          Players that we were given reason to believe had a path to outperform
          and we're cheap as throw ins, or for less than a future 2nd, or many
          just free on waivers:{' '}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Kyren Williams- we were told by the coaching staff that they loved him
          and he would have a large role in the offense. We didn't believe them
          and thought it was Akers backfield. They told us and the cost to find
          out was almost nothing. <br />
          <br />
          Joshua kelley- the coaching staff and Austin Ekeler himself told us
          they wanted another back to take significant work. Kelley was clearly
          that guy and looked great in the preseason. It cost almost nothing to
          find out. <br />
          <br /> Kenny Gainwell was treated as the starter for basically all of
          August. No one believed it.
          <br />
          <br /> Zay Jones was very good last year and the Jags showed us that
          he would be playing over Kirk in two wide sets on a team that doesn't
          run a ton of three wide sets. Even after that, because we didn't want
          to believe in Zay Jones, you could have traded Kirk for Zay plus just
          days before week 1. <br />
          <br /> Two QB's that we're cheap relative to other QB's: <br />
          <br />
          Brock Purdy: Purdy was fantasy gold in every game he played last year
          and the only thing we ever heard from the coaches was that he was the
          starter. Given the relative prices for QB's in superflex he was an
          absolutely massive bargain all offseason because we were too afraid to
          be wrong even when the cost was low. <br />
          <br />
          Mac Jones: Everyone was out on Mac Jones and like Purdy he could be
          had for next to nothing relative to other starting QB's all off-season
          when his only bad year was with a D coordinator calling his offense
          and an OC coming to town that threw the ball 600 times the last year
          he was the OC for this same team. You could have added purdy and Mac
          to any team for an absolute bargain this offseason.{' '}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Takeaway:</strong> On all of these players we were given, or
          straight up shown, paths for them to greatly outperform their cost and
          whether we believed the story to be plausible or not shouldn't have
          stopped us from paying the cheap, or sometimes free, price to find
          out. This game we love is too high variance and even the best are
          wrong all the time. we have to have the humility to admit we don't
          know and pay a low cost on players that could be big hits if we are
          wrong and only small loses if we are right.

          The front and the racket/players still to buy or hold
        </h2>
        <p>
          Much like a 1920's era organized crime ran business in the front,
          casino in the back, week 1 presents us with situations that have
          fronts and rackets. In a game where, even the best players see a large
          variance from week to week in fantasy points scored, a one week sample
          size of fantasy points can often be a front and the underlying usage
          of the players and their teammates is the racket that holds the true
          story.
        </p>{' '}
        <br />
        <h3>
          <strong> Buys, stashes, and holds after week 1:</strong>{' '}
        </h3>
        <br />
        Raheem Mostert- age and an injury prone label hanging over Mostert keep
        his price low in dynasty despite him being a glaring buy. His modest
        fantasy point total from week 1 is both a product of how Miami scored in
        this game and hides his usage. Mostert operated as a 73% snap share bell
        cow who has historiclly high efficiency in a high scoring offense. He
        took all but 3 of Miami's RB touches. That's a player every manager
        should want on their team and yet he can still be acquired well below
        what his production would dictate
        <br />
        <br />
        Rashee Rice- the Chiefs played in an island game without Travis Kelce
        and the whole country watched the game and came away with the thought
        that all the Chiefs WR's are trash. The underlying usage paints a
        different and exploitable picture. MVS and Skyy Moore played by far the
        most snaps and ran far the most routes yet toney and Rice had the most
        targets. Their TPRR numbers were actually really good and while Toney
        looked terrible Rice did not. It's reasonable to conclude that going
        forward Rice will see more snaps and routes and no reason he can't
        become the number 2 weapon for Mahomes behind Kelce and his price
        currently absolutely does not reflect this possibility and upside.
        <br />
        <br />
        Quenton Johnston- Johnston was the WR4 on the chargers is something you
        will hear a lot this week. While that was technically true let's look at
        QJ and Josh Palmer's usage and production. <br />
        Palmer- 64% snaps 1 target
        <br />
        Johnston- 27% snaps 3 targets <br />
        The writing is all over the wall that this is the classic bet on talent
        situation that you actually want to make. A highly talented rookie
        showing well on low volume that can explode down the stretch when they
        earn more volume. <br />
        <br /> Romeo Doubs- I love Christan Watson, he is a big play waiting to
        happen and will undoubtedly have some huge games this year. If we take
        off our Christian Watson colored glasses though it's obvious that when
        Doubs is healthy and on the field he is Love's favorite target in and
        out of the end zone. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to see Doubs
        outscore Watson on a per game basis this year. This feels like a Keenan
        Allen/Mike Williams situation all over again and give me the Keenan
        Allen before he and his price explodes all day
        <br />
        <br />
        Jerry Jeudy- Russell Wilson looked like his old self in the first half
        before Sean Payton changed the offensive game plan at half. It was clear
        this offense plans on operating it's air attack through Jeudy and was
        out of sorts without him. If Payton can get close to classic Russell
        Wilson efficiency and Jeudy is the focal point through the air he can be
        a league winner. If anyone wholesale doubts this offense Jeudy is
        someone I'd love to take off their hands
        <br />
        <br />
        Jaxon Smith-Njigba- I don't expect his price to ever go down but if his
        volume is low enough for long enough that he is ever available, even at
        full cost buy, buy, buy! He is an elite prospect that will be next to
        impossible to acquire after this year
        <br />
        <br />
        Jake Furgeson- almost all the fantasy points totals in this game are
        fronts. This was such a bizarre game environment. Looking at Furgeson's
        underlying usage though is very encouraging. He saw a 72% snap share and
        saw 7 targets. The rainy conditions likely had a lot to do with him only
        turning those into 2 catches but that kind of snap share and volume at
        the still low cost of Furgeson is enticing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Trey McBride and Cole Turner- these two saw almost no work in week 1
        while the over 30 veterans with long and recent injury histories ahead
        of them saw elite volume and did little with it. The commanders offense
        and Josh Dobbs are going to target TE's at an extreme rate and both
        McBride and Turner are far superior athletes than the aging veterans in
        front of them at this stage of their careers. If either vet were to miss
        time this year the young guns behind them are ready to be take on and be
        more productive with that volume.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ty Chandler- Alexander mattison was terrible on a lot of volume. Keep
        Chandler stashed, he could be a pricey waiver wire darling later this
        year.
        <br />
        <p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Closing thought:</strong> breece hall will be overall RB1 if
          Zach Wilson is QB all year. He has game breaking ability on any run
          and can score toucdowns from distance. Zach Wilson showed last year he
          will give the RB's a massive amount of targets. Hall will be a league
          winner as long as Wilson is under center.
